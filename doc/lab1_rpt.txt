List of Design Features
----------------------------------------
ID:Design Feature
----------------------------------------
1: Hold Mode: hold current data going to DUT and coming out from DUT 

2: Load Mode: load data into register

3: Increment Mode: data coming out from DUT is increase by 1 from data input

4: Decrement Mode: data coming out from DUT is decrease by 1 from data input

5: 8 bits up down counter register: the maxinum number comming out from DUT is 255. It can roll over from 255 to 0 and roll under vise versa (0 to 255) 

6: bug_mode: this register can turn on bug mode depend on student Number

7: Reset: data coming into DUT will be come 0 if reset =1 at positive clock

List of Test cases
----------------------------------------
ID:Task	Description
----------------------------------------
1:reset_test:
Reset test test whether data coming into DUT is 0 after reset=1 at positive clk_in.
4 Scenarios will be tested :reset will be on while running 4 different mode(hold, load, increment and decrement)

2:sanity_check
Check connect when load data into DUT to see if signal output will come out from DUT to test bench

3:test_load_data
load 4 different data value values to see if the connection between testbench and DUT is established. 
Compare whether data going out from test bench is equal to data coming into testbech from DUT after clock cycle.
It need 2 clk cycle to check(1 clk cycle to load data into DUT, another clk cycle to check in the test bench)

4:test_hold_mode
hold mode is test under 2 scenarios. One is in decrement mode, another is in increment mode.The proceduce is the same for both scenarios
    Load data into DUT
    Change mode to decrement or increment
    Change mode to hold after couple of clock cycle (7 clk cycle in this case)
    running on many clock cycle to see if data coming out from test bench is equal to data going into test bench from DUT

5: test_increment_mode
change mode to increment. let DUT run repeatly and check if data coming out from DUT is increase everytime by 1
(data must not be 255)

6: test_increment_with_roll_over_mode
change mode to increment. let DUT run repeatly and check if data coming out from DUT is 0 if previous data is 255

7: test_decrement_mode
change mode to derement. let DUT run repeatly and check if data coming out from DUT is decrease everytime by 1
(data must not be 0)

8: test_decrement_with_roll_under_mode
change mode to decrement. let DUT run repeatly and check if data coming out from DUT is 255 if previous data is 0

Embedded Bugs
----------------------------------------
ID:Description
----------------------------------------
1: Bugs happened while using load mode. Output coming out from DUT is 255 regardless of input comming into the DUT

2: No roll over when input coming into DUT is 255. output going out from DUT is still 255.

3: When in decrement mode, if input coming into DUT is 255, the output coming out from DUT is decrese by 2 instead of 1

4: Reset is not working when data count up to 255 in increment mode. Data hold at value of 255 instead of 0

5: If reset_in = 1. data coming out from DUT is 255. if between 0- 2 clock cycle reset turn to 0, data will not coming out from DUT.
 But after waiting for 2 clock cycle , if reset_in = 0 data will come out from DUT
